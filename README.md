This app is an app to create yoga sequences based on the yoga types the user selects.

The first screen welcomes the user and gives a brief explanation of what the app is for.
The app is simply for creating random yoga sequences when you need a little creativity and don't want to copy someone else's.
The user hits the Start button

The second screen - is for the user to pick the type of yoga he/she wants to practice ex. backbends, inversions, etc.
The user must pick at least 1 yoga type.
The user must also specify for how long the pose should display in seconds.
Once the user hits the OM button again the sequence will display. 
The user will be able to decide if he/she wants to go ahead with that sequence - hit OM button; or try a new sequence by clicking the Try again button.
If user selects OM button - the sequence slideshow will start and each pose will display for however many seconds the user set the timer in the previous screen- the sequence will repeat until the user clicks the home link or App logo in the navigation bar.
If user decides they didn't like the sequence - they can click on Try Again button to create a new sequence.

The user can click on the home link and app logo to go to the home(main) screen.  There is also an about link that gives the user a little more information about the app.
